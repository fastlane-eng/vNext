# Service Template

This directory provides a template for a service in the FastLane vNext monorepo.

- `src/` - Source code for the service.
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests for the service.
- `docs/` - Service-specific documentation.

Use this skeleton as a starting point when creating new microservices.
